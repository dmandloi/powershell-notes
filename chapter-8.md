### Chapter 8

* To list the members \(i.e. properties and methods\) available on any powershell object, use `Get-Member` cmdlet.
* Objects can have different types of properties such a _Property, AliasProperty, ScriptProperty,_ and _NoteProperty. _Out of these only properties of type Property are actually defined on the native powershell objects. Other types are dynamically created by the shell such as an AliasProperty which is a property  renamed to something else.
