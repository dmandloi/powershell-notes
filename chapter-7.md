### Chapter 7

* Powershell automatically loads cmdlets from a set of well known folders. To get a list of well known folders searched by Powershell to load cmdlets use `dir Env:PSModulePath`

* Powershell can run a script called `profile.ps1` when the shell starts up. This script needs to be present in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell`
